# Validus
Validus Case study

Should contain a jupyiter lab notebook containing my results and use of the package validus_pkg_test also included in this repository. The validus_pkg_test file also contains a testing file with two very simple tests of a funciton I implemented.

validus_pkg_test is include on PyPi and test PyPi so should be available to install via pip.
